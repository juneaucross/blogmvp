				In many ways, Estonia is a unique country. On the one hand, it has striking cultural parallels with its Scandinavian
				neighbors; on the other hand, centuries of relations with the Slavic world have also left their mark on the country.
				Always forward-looking, this nation in northeastern Europe has carved out a niche for itself and offers something quite
				unique for a short vacation.
